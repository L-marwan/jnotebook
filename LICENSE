  source projects.

  JNOTEBOOK may be used under the terms of the GNU General Public License
  version 3 as published by the Free Software Foundation and appearing

  The JNOTEBOOK open source licensing is ideal for use cases such as
  Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL
  that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with
  JNOTEBOOK software, student/academic purposes, hobby projects,
  internal research projects without external distribution,
  or other projects where all GPL obligations can be met.



Commercial License Usage

  OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software
  Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that:
  - combine and distribute commercially licensed software with JNOTEBOOK
  AND/OR
  - use JNOTEBOOK source code as input data for statistical algorithms
  and distribute commercially licensed software including such statistical
  algorithms and/or any of their outputs
  must enter into a commercial license agreement with Cyril de Catheu.

  The commercial JNOTEBOOK license gives you the full rights to create
  and distribute software on your own terms without any open source
  license obligations. With the commercial license you also have
  access to the official JNOTEBOOK Support and close strategic relationship
  with Cyril de Catheu to make sure your development goals are met.
